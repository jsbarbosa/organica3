@book{Gilbert2010,
abstract = {Providing even more emphasis on inquiry-based learning, a new green experiment, and more than a dozen new discovery experiments, this Fifth Edition of Gilbert and Martin's proven EXPERIMENTAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY contains procedures for both miniscale (also known as small scale) and microscale users. The manual first covers equipment, record keeping, and safety in the laboratory, then walks students step by step through the laboratory techniques they need to perform the book's experiments with confidence. Chapters show students how to use the book's techniques to synthesize compounds and analyze their properties, complete multi-step syntheses of organic compounds, and solve structures of unknown compounds. A bioorganic experiment in Chapter 24 reflects the increasing emphasis on bioorganic chemistry in the course and gives students an opportunity to accomplish a mechanistically interesting and synthetically important coupling of two a-amino acids to produce a dipeptide.Important Notice: Media content referenced within the product description or the product text may not be available in the ebook version.},
